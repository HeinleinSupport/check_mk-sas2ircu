description:
 This check monitors the state of the physical disks and volumes
 of LSI SAS2008, Dell PERC H200 raid controllers (used in Dell R200, R210, R210II servers).
 The Linux agent sends the neccessary data,
 if the command line utility {sas2ircu} is found in the shells
 search path. 

 The utility {sas2ircu} debian x64 package can be downloaded from
 {http://hwraid.le-vert.net/debian/pool-wheezy/sas2ircu_16.00.00.00-1_amd64.deb} and
 installed with {dpkg -i sas2ircu_16.00.00.00-1_amd64.deb}.

item:
 For volumes: The word 'VOLUME' followed by the controller number (1st controller={0}),
 the volume id and the volume raid type and size.
 For example {"VOLUME 0/79 (raid1, 1862GB)"} means a volume on 1st controller {0} with
 id {79} using {raid1} with a size of {1862GB}.
 For disks: The word 'DISK' followed by the controller number (1st controller={0}),
 the disk number, the disk model and serial and disk type.
 For example {"DISK 0/1 ST2000NM0023_Z1X091JJ (SAS_HDD)"} means a disk on 1st controller {0}, 
 the 2nd disk {1} of model and serial {ST2000NM0023_Z1X091JJ} which is a {SAS_HDD} disk type.

inventory:
 All disks and volumes of all controllers are automatically inventorized. The current state is
 taken as the target state.
